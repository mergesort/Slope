- `GradientAngle` has been added. You can choose from four predefined angles (`.vertical`, `.horizontal`, `.bottomLeftToTopRight`, `topLeftToBottomRight`) or initialize your own start and end points.

### Breaking changes

- `GradientDirection` has been removed. If you need to use `GradientDirection.darkToLight`, instead use the `.reversed` property of `GradientAngle`.
